# Hyperthyroid_python_analysis

This project seek to build a model that can predict if a patient has hyperthyroid based on symptoms.
We will use decision trees and SVM to do prediction

## Procedure
the following are steps taken to do the analysis

1. Data Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Data Cleaning
4. Perform EDA
5. Modelling
6. Evaluation

## Tools Used
** Python(Pandas Library, Numpy Library, SeabornLibrary, SciPy Library,Sci-kit Learn)

** Google Colab

** Jupyter Notebook
